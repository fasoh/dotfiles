# Dotfiles for Development

My custom dotfiles for vim and common editors.

## Install script

Run `sh installdotfiles.sh` to both backup your existing dotfiles to 
`~/dotfiles_backup` and place the dotfiles from this repository in your `~`. You 
probably need to edit installdotfiles.sh in order to match your folder 
structure.
