## Requirements
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for easy zsh plugin 
  management i.e. the [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) 
  theme.
  * Install zsh-syntax-highlighting with `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh && git clone git://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git`
  * Install z (for faster terminal navigation) with homebrew using `brew install z`
* [Menlo for Powerline](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline) because 
  the agnoster theme requires a patched font to properly display some elements.
